						What is ModulTrade’s target market?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Micro, small and medium enterprises globally that currently do not have access to international trade market due to high entry barriers, capacity constraints or complete absence of suitable trade financing services.
						<p class="i">Traditionally, trade finance business has targeted exporters and importers of a certain size and in certain geographies, with only mid-range to larger players being able to afford trade finance services. In developed countries, the share of MSME exports in total exports in 2013 was 34 per cent. The equivalent share on the import side was 38 per cent. In developing countries the numbers are similar. [*] There is clearly a big segment unserved or underserved by banks and other trade finance industry players globally. Clearly, this segment struggles to enjoy the opportunities that international trade could offer them.</p>

						How big is ModulTrade’s target market?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Roughly $6.5 trl and over 400 mln MSMEs globally.
						<p>It is approximate volume of trade that does not happen due to rejection of trade finance requests, lack of availability of or access to suitable and affordable trade finance options, complexity of options, administrative and monetary burden, lack of trust between counterparties, lack of trust between trade intermediators (banks), etc. [**]</p>
						<p>Global trade volume in 2015 - $18.5trl [*]
						Share of MSME export/import, approximately - 35%. $18.5trl * 35% = $6.5 trl
						Over 50% of MSME trade finance requests are rejected, compared to only 7% for multinational corporations. About 68% of companies do not seek alternatives for rejected transactions, and have a lack of awareness about the types of trade finance products which exist on the market. [**]<br>
						Potential market roughly is the trade that does not happen because of rejection - $6.5trl / 50% * 50% = $6.5trl</p>

						What is MTRc?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						MTRc is a crypto token issued by ModulTrade which enables its users to connect ​​to ​​the ​​ModulTrade ​​platform ​​and ​​its ​​ecosystem, to make transactions, and to pay fees for the services consumed.
						In order to ensure the portfolio of tools and services offered by ModulTrade and its partners provides high trust at comparatively low cost without reliance on expensive and inflexible established trade intermediators (banks), ModulTrade is going to make heavy use of blockchain technology.
						<p class="t">Trade counterparties may be unwilling to trade in MTRc or ETH because they do not want to take exchange rate risks. How do you plan to address this issue?</p>
						<p>ModulTrade or its partners can provide short-term escrow service to trade counterparties. In such a case, a trade face value will be paid in fiat currency to an escrow provider, while ecosystem and service commission will be paid with MTRc tokens.</p>
						<p>A buyer will transfer the trade face value in fiat currency to the dedicated escrow account. Escrow provider will allocate trust collateral in MTRc tokens to the smart contract. The amount of the trust collateral will be sufficient to account for potential MTRc price volatility during the trade period.  When trade is complete, escrow provider will transfer the trade face value in fiat currency to the seller. In the unlikely event that this does not happen, MTRc tokens from the trust deposit will be used to automatically pay the trade face value to the seller. In case of a dispute, ModulTrade will play the role of an arbiter to decide which party is to receive which portion of the trust collateral.. The trade and service commissions will be paid in MTRc tokens to ensure ecosystem and transaction efficiency.</p>
						<p>Obviously, this type of transaction is not as efficient and cheap as a purely crypto token transaction. However, it proves to be a great compromise until MTRc gains wider acceptance.</p>

						What are ModulTrade’s pilot market segments and geographies? Why?

					<div class="content">
						ModulTrade’s pilot geographies are Germany, UK and Italy, as these countries combined have the largest number of MSMEs in Europe. ModulTrade’s pilot segment will be construction, as it has the largest proportion of MSMEs compared to other segments, it involves extremely high volume of cross border trade and is highly interconnected with global supply chains.
						<p class="i"><b>Germany</b>. The largest economy in Europe and the 4th largest by nominal GDP in the world. Has the highest trade surplus in the world (US$ 310 bln in 2016) and is the 3rd largest exporter in the world (US$ 1,21 trl in 2016). 99% of SMEs are family-owned.

						Who are your competitors, direct and indirect?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Direct competitors are established players in the trade finance industry, including global and local banks and financing organizations, as well as online retail and wholesale platforms such as Amazon, eBay and Alibaba.

						<p>Indirect competitors are shipping companies, retail networks, e-commerce providers, insurance companies that can establish trade finance branch of their business or offer alternative solutions.</p>

						<p>Another group of competitors is new startups with a similar idea but different audience or business model, e.g. Staffandgo, Monetha.</p>

						<div class="ico"></div>
						What would prevent Amazon, Alibaba and the likes to do the same as you? What if they do it?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Behemoths such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay would need to make a turnabout of their business model and strategy which they might not be ready to commit to. For example, Alibaba pursuing this strategy would risk cannibalizing its own established business. Therefore, if they indeed decide to change they will probably become entirely different companies then.

						What is your go-to-market strategy?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Creating network effect is key for us. We plan to piggyback on the reach and penetration of existing e-commerce platforms, individual B2B merchant websites and existing marketplaces as much as possible by creating a button ”Trade with ModulTrade” that MSMEs could embed into their websites and marketplaces to allow their clients to trade via us. Similar to the “Pay with Paypal” button. An app to be able to execute an ad-hoc trade with a mobile phone, for example in a brick and mortar store, is also something we consider.

						Product and Technology
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<span class="t">What are the core technologies your solution will be based on?</span>
						<p>In order to ensure the portfolio of tools and services offered by ModulTrade and its partners provides high trust at comparatively low cost, ModulTrade is going to make heavy use of Distributed Ledger Technology (or blockchain) and Smart Contracts.</p>
						<p class="i">Distributed Ledger Technology will record all transactions on the platform in a reliable and immutable way and share information between involved counterparties. Smart contracts, which can be thought of as programmatic representations of real world contracts, will ensure trustworthy, independent and guaranteed execution of terms and conditions of the actual legal trade contracts that they will represent.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<div class="title">
						<div class="ico"></div>
						Why do you need blockchain and smart contracts?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Blockchain and smart contract technologies will allow us to minimize operational costs, financial inefficiencies and other frictions associated with manual administration, transaction support, trade execution and conflict resolution.
						<p class="i">These technologies allow to create platforms and ecosystems with built-in trust characteristics which, in traditional world, is typically achieved by using laborious and inefficient processes for document exchange, recording, auditing, bookkeeping and reconciliation. DLT and smart contract technologies are capable of eliminating these frictions and therefore have potential to eliminate associated tremendous cost overkill. [*]</p>

					<div class="title">
						<div class="ico"></div>
						What are the most common transaction schemes on ModulTrade platform?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						All transactions on ModulTrade’s platform will be based on smart contracts.
						<p>In a simplistic Letter of Credit implementation, MTRc tokens representing value of exchanged assets will be blocked in smart contracts until delivery and acceptance of assets happens and is confirmed. Should there be a conflict, a simple conflict resolution protocol will be embedded in the contract.</p>
						<p>In a StandBy Letter of Credit contract, one of the parties will be granted a short-term MTRc limit for StandBy. The amount of the limit will be a function of the party’s reputation score represented in the form of reputation capital.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<div class="title">
						<div class="ico"></div>
						What is reputation score and reputation capital?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Reputation score is a quantitative measure that reflects the trustworthiness, reliability and track record of a counterparty. Reputation capital is a limit in MTRc dependent on reputation score which ModulTrade ecosystem participants can use when they trade or consume services.
						<p class="i">The counterparty’s reputation score will be calculated as a function of the number and the quality of transactions executed. Among other things, it will depend on the number of resolved and unresolved disputes, the rate of successful and failed deliveries, the rate of returns, peer rating, and other metrics. Conceptually similar to credit scoring, the higher the reputation score of a party is the cheaper it becomes for it to trade on ModulTrade and use its ecosystem services. Certain high scores will also give access to additional beneficial services.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<div class="title">
						<div class="ico"></div>
						Again, what is MTRc and what role does it play?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						MTRc is a crypto token which will be used in the ModulTrade platform and enable its users to connect ​​to ​​the ecosystem, to make transactions, to use services, and to pay fees for the services consumed. You can think of it as of a convenient means to do operations on the platform which eliminates bottlenecks and inefficiencies of handling fiat currencies directly. Figuratively speaking, it is “the blood of the ecosystem”. It will be possible to purchase MTRc tokens with your local currency and vise versa.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<div class="title">
						<div class="ico"></div>
						Why do you use MTRc tokens and not bitcoin or fiat money?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						MTRc vs fiat money
						<ul>
							<li>MTRc tokens are more technologically suitable for blockchain-based transactions than fiat money.</li>
							<li>MTRc tokens help to avoid transaction fees from intermediaries such as banks and payment processors.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>MTRc vs bitcoin</p>
						<ul>
							<li>MTRc are pre-mined, one-purpose tokens designed to be used only on ModulTrade platform, while bitcoin is a general-purpose highly volatile cryptocurrency which legal treatment in some jurisdictions is sometimes under question.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>At the same time, in order to meet the needs of our clients, it will be possible to purchase MTRc tokens with fiat currencies and bitcoin.</p>

						Risks, Regulation and Compliance
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<span class="t">What are the general risks that ModulTrade faces or might face?</span>
						<p>Many of the risks that ModulTrade faces or might face are similar to those faced by other financial service providers, both incumbents and fintech startups. Besides the traditional business and financial risks, ModulTrade is subject to the following.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Regulatory risk</li>
							<li>Fraud risk</li>
							<li>Technology risk</li>
							<li>Model risk</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<div class="title">
						<div class="ico"></div>
						How are you going to address them?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Regulatory risk is always something to be aware of. The only way of addressing it is keeping our eyes open and analysing how regulatory landscape changes in jurisdictions where we offer our services. Luckily, more and more jurisdictions chose to take a constructive attitude towards fintechs, including UK, Singapore, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada. [*, **]
						<p>Technology risk is partially mitigated by heavy reliance on strong, extremely vibrant and active, competent community surrounding blockchain technologies.</p>
						<p>Fraud and model risk will be partially mitigated by embedding well-tested contract resolution protocols in smart contracts, and partially by delegating these risks to specialized service providers in the open ModulTrade Value Ecosystem which possess far wider expertise in their respective domains and know how to handle risks inherent in their business operations.</p>

						What are the mechanisms that ModulTrade plans to put in place against various types of fraud?
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						The biggest source of fraud on the ModulTrade platform is inability to completely automate and decentralize using blockchain certain real-world processes. This makes it impossible to guarantee complete and ultimate trust in absolute variety of cases.
						<p>In such cases, ModulTrade is going to rely on one of the following approaches.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In certain extreme or complex cases, we will put in place a specific trust-neutral equal-rights conflict resolution protocol based on payout negotiation between counterparties. In case consensus is not reached regarding the mutual payout (which typically happens in case of fraud by one or both counterparties), the funds will remain blocked on the contract. The funds will be released when counterparties agree or a specifically appointed 3rd party decides on their behalf.</li>
							<li>Parties noticed in fraudulent behaviour will be banned from the system, while parties behaving honestly will be gaining higher reputation score which will allow them to transact cheaper.</li>
							<li>Finally, we are ready to accept that certain comparatively low level of fraud is unavoidable. Our business model will be ready to absorb this level of fraud.</li>

					<div class="content">
						As a company offering financial services, ModulTrade is determined to be compliant to applicable regulations in the jurisdictions it will operate in. In particular, it will have or might have to comply with the following. [*]
